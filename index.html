        <div class="line"></div>
        <p> As I mentioned above, my hobby of drawing started when I was 6.At first, I was just using colors to paint. I used just to draw some random pictures. I used to draw something every day. That is how I developed my drawing skills. I used to take part in various competitions. I was very interested in taking part in multiple events. I won a trophie for the Swatch Bharat Art Exellence Award at the age of 6 in class 2.
            <br><br>I was the state level winner in Assam. Apart from that, when I improved my skill, I started painting for others. I used to draw for my friends, cousins, and family members. I used to participate in school events. I am popular among my friends in my school . Everyone wanted to make drawing for them. It gave me more motivation to do something new and to upgrade my skill.

            <p>Everyone in this world has someone who means a lot to them. For me, the most important person in my life is my mother. My mother has inspired me in many ways. She is always guiding me to do the right thing; she supports me and my decisions and tells me to believe in myself. Therefore, my mom is the most important person for me. The word “mother” means everything to me.

                I remember when I was little I would always be with my mom and she would always take care of me when I got sick.<br>Mother taught me how to speak, read, and write sentences; and also taught me how to be a good person. When I did something wrong, she explained to me why I can’t do that. When I have problems with friends in school and I did not know who to talk with, she was the one I could open up to and tell her how I felt.

                She told me how to solve these conflicts and pointed out how the conflicts started in the first place.

                Ever since I could remember, my mother is everything for me; doctor, teacher, friend, advisor, and many more. When I did not know which choices to make, I usually asked my mother. I know my mother will always be behind me one-hundred percent. It is a good feeling. The only person that always listened to me was my mom. She never acted like, “how many times I need to tell you,” or “just choose something—I don’t care! ” Instead, she always explained how each of the things is different and guided me along the way.

                However, the decisions are mine to make, and whether I become successful or not in the future depends on me. But, she will love me unconditionally. My mother has always been a very strong role model to me, and growing up with someone like her to look up to has made me who I am. She has helped me grow. She taught me to always love, care, and give back to people. Never criticize or make fun of others because you never know what they have been true in their life. Being a mother takes a lot of patience and she has patience with me.

                I know my mother has made sacrifices for me and works hard to give me everything I need and most of the things I want. The things I have learned and continue to learn from my Mother are endless. She has taught me to be a better person. I am very thankful for her. Though we might not always get along or we don’t see everything the same way, she appreciates my views. My mother will continue to inspire me. Everything she always did was more than just Love; it is much deeper than any other love. </p>
